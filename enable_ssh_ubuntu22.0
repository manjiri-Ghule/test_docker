#To ensure your script works on an Ubuntu 22.04 AWS EC2 instance using the user data option, here are the adjustments:

#Add the #!/bin/bash at the start of the script.
#Use cloud-init syntax for user data scripts.
#Remove the unnecessary commands like exit 1 which will stop the script execution if the user exists.
#Ensure correct handling of sudo commands within the user data context.
#Here’s the adjusted script:


#!/bin/bash

username="devops"
password="password"

# Create the user if it doesn't exist
if ! id "$username" &>/dev/null; then
    sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash "$username"
    echo "$username:$password" | sudo chpasswd
    echo "$username ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/"$username"
fi

# Enable SSH password authentication
sudo sed -i 's/^PasswordAuthentication\s*no/PasswordAuthentication yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo sed -i 's/^PasswordAuthentication\s*no/PasswordAuthentication yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/60-cloudimg-settings.conf
sudo systemctl restart sshd

echo "User $username created with password, full sudo permissions, and SSH login setup."
#To use this script as user data when launching an EC2 instance:

# Open the EC2 console and go through the steps to launch an instance.
# In the "Configure Instance" step, find the "Advanced Details" section.
# In the "User data" field, paste the script.
# This will run the script on the first boot of the instance, setting up the user as required
